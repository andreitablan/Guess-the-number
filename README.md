# GUESS THE NUMBER
Interactive server-client application. It was developed for the Python discipline.
### [Demo](https://youtu.be/OTGeD9U5ZVc)
- A server-client application will be created to replicate the Guess the Number game.
- The number to be guessed will be in the range [0, 50]. There will be two possibilities: either the number will be generated by the server or provided by another client if two people want to play.
- With each attempt to guess the number, the client will receive one of the following messages: "The number is correct," "The number is smaller," or "The number is larger" than the chosen number.
- Each script run will represent a game session, consisting of multiple game rounds.
- At the end of the session, the maximum score will be displayed, representing the lowest number of attempts required to discover the number.
